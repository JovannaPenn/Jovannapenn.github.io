    <div class= "abouttext"> Hello my name is Jovanna Penn-Reina. I am a 18 year old, first year Creative Media Production at Massey University Wellington. 
        <p>I am from Whanganui, New Zealand. I love photography and filmmaking. My favourite kind of photography is landscape photography. I don't really enjoy working with models that often. I love capturing the nature and landscpaes around me. Living in New Zealand gives me a great opportunity to do this because New Zealand has beautiful landscapes everywhere.</p>
        <p>My portfolio displays a body of my work from 2017, that features some photos I've taken of landscapes and environments. It was taken at a war memorial park in Wellington, New Zealand. I really just wanted to capture the beauty of the park</p>
        <p>My work from this year, 2018, features basketball as the theme. I covered a basketball in glowsticks to capture the movement of the ball. Most basketball photography captures the movement of the player, although I did also do this I wanted to be able to take a different approach.</p>
        <p>All of these photos are important to me being able to express myself through arts.</p>
